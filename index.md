This is the unofficial user page of **David Liu**. 

David is a *Junior* undergrad ~~Math~~ CS student in UCSD. 

**David's favorite manga series of all time is *Attack on Titan***. 

***Currently, David is still adjusting to the CS working environment and tools, so he is extremely noob in every CS related topic.***

As the great mathematician David Hilbert once said: 
> Wir mÃ¼ssen wissen. 
> Wir werden wissen.

I am currently learning `git` related commands and tools. 

My most hated code block of all time:
```c++
if (true) {
    return true;
}

else {
    return false;
}
```
